Overview of the Project Description
The Swing framework in Java was used to create this simple 3D FPS (First-Person Shooter) game project. Using raycasting to create the illusion of 3D, the player moves through a 2D maze in the first person. With its mini-map, health management, and end goal, the game tests the player's ability to get to the exit while dodging obstacles. The project's objectives are to illustrate interactive GUI components, game mechanics, and the basics of raycasting.

Qualities
A simple 3D effect produced by figuring out where rays intersect walls is called 3D Raycasting Simulation.
Minimap: A 2D map updated in real time that aids players in navigating the maze.
Player Health Management: When a player hits a wall, their health drops.
The screens are straightforward interfaces that show a winning message and initiate the game.
User Controls: Complete control for angle adjustment and navigation with WASD keys.
Specifications for Executing the Application
Version 8 or higher of the Java JDK
Any Java Swing project-supporting IDE, such as NetBeans
Configuring and Gathering
Repository cloning or project file downloads are both possible.
Launch your IDE and open the project:
Choose "Open Project" in NetBeans, then find the project folder.
Construct the Project:
Click the project in the Project Explorer in NetBeans, then choose "Build Project."
Launch the application:
To launch the main class (FPSJFrame.java), right-click on it and choose "Run File," or hit Shift + F6.

Controls for the Usage Guide
W: Proceed A: Turn to the left
S: Go backward
D: Turn to the right.
Enter: Launch the main screen of the game.
Start of the game: To start the game, press "Enter" on the Startup Screen.
Goal: Use the controls and minimap to navigate the maze and get to the end indicated on the minimap.
Health Management: To maintain health, steer clear of frequent collisions with walls. Every time you hit a wall, your health drops by ten points.
Final Screen: The congratulations screen appears when you reach the specified end. To close the application, hit "Enter" once more.
Applied Event-Handling Skills: Managing keyboard inputs for game states and player movement.
Swing: Developing custom components, managing rendering, and constructing the GUI layout.


Utilized Technologies
Java Swing: For rendering graphics and GUI elements.
AWT: Used to manage keyboard events and graphics.
Multi-Threading: To ensure fluid game updates and frame rendering.
